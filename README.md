# fnaf-1-discord-bot-game
i made fnaf 1 in a discord bot (using pictures)

all credits to Scott Cawthon

if you want this taken down contact me, i just made it for fun.


second python project so its not gonna be the best.
i made everything myself (except for the pictures ðŸ«¢, i want to make them actually gifs or some, but that takes so much time and stuff so im not even gonna bother)
